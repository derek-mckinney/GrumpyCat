GrumpyCat FAQ
-------------
Launch Date: February 16th, 2021

Blockchain Type: Public, Decentralized, UTXO based, Multi-Algorithm

Ticker Symbol: GRUMP

Max Total Supply: 21 Billion GrumpyCats

Block Reward Reduction: 1% Monthly

Mining Algorithms: Five individual: SHA256, Scrypt, Odocrypt, Skein & Qubit

Block Interval: 15 Second Blocks (75 seconds per algo)

Algo Block Share: 20% Block Share Per Algo (5)

SegWit Support: Yes.

You can mine GrumpyCat on one of five separate mining algorithms. Each algo averages out to mine 20% of new blocks. This allows for much greater decentralization than other blockchains. An attacker with 99% of of any individual algorithm would still be unable to hardfork the blockchain, making GrumpyCat much more secure against PoW attacks than other blockchains.
